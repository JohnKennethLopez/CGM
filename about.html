                            <h1>Histoy of Church of God's Miracles</h1><br><br>
                            <p>
                            The Church of God's Miracles was established in 1991 by a group of Pastors and believers called by God. These believers have patiently organized numerous meetings in Buli Elementary School in order to establish a new church. Through the help and guidance from the Lord God the CHURCH OF GOD'S MIRACLES (CGM) was born on July 16, 1991. Ptr. Camilo L. Principe the appointed Administrative Pastor, together with seven (7) elders and seven (7) deacons were selected to lead the church.
                            <br><br>
	                        The first central office and Sunday Worship Celebration was held at the 3rd floor Rosa Building, Montillano St. Alabang, Muntinlupa City. God continuously works wonders and miracles in the church. Many have turned their faith to Jesus and with such numerous new Christians attending the Sunday Worship celebration, three (3) services were held two (2) in the morning and one (1) in the afternoon. Mid-week service during Wednesdays and Miracles Night during Fridays were likewise opened. Due to huge number of new workers, CGM started its new Christian Workers Training School to fully train and equips workers in the proper way of teaching and sharing the gospel of Christ.
                            <br><br>
	                        With the vast expansion of the church, CGM transferred to Manuela 2 Cinema 6 and its office was transferred to J. Villanueva 3 Compound, Almanza, Las Piñas City.
                            <br><br>
                            New leaders were voted and appointed under the leadership of Ptr. Frankie L. Beato, Senior Pastor. Through the new leadership and by the grace of God, workers participated in doing their share of work in developing and establishing a better church to widen the scope of spreading the Word of God. Within a short period of time, the new administration successfully continues to meet its goal in reaching for the lost souls and bringing them back to God.  
                            <br><br>
                            The church adapted a pastoral policy wherein the Senior Pastor acts as chairman of all the business meetings including the administration of the church.
                            <br><br>
                            Eventually CGM transferred to its church building at Lot 1A Liderato Hernandez St., Metrocor South Gate Homes, Almanza Uno, Las Piñas City where the Worship Services are held and its office is located.
                            <br><br>
	                        Today CGM has seventeen (17) chapters, six (6) districts and twelve (12) areas in different parts of NCR and provinces. all for the highest gratitude and thanksgiving to the one and only founder and head of the church, The Lord Jesus Christ!
